I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at [Visual Computing research Center](https://vcc.tech).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree under supervision of [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang) and [Prof. Ruizhen Hu](http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/ruizhenhu) from [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn) in 2021.
I received my Bachelor degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn) in 2016.

My research interests are shape/scene understanding, point cloud analysis, 3D reconstruction.

I love taking photos in my spare time, welcome to [take a look](https://500px.me/salingo) :D
